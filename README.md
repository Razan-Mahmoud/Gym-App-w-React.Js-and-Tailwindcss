# The ultimate gym app, built with React.JS and Tailwindcss

This app provides a great number of cool exercises, along with their explanations and a counter to register how many times you trained a day. The App is built with React.Js, Vite, Font Awesome and Tailwindcss. I followed the instructions found in SmolJames's awesome video -link bellow- where I had fun coding. It's really a pleasure coding with your videos, Mr. James McArthur ðŸ˜Š, and thanks a lot for all your efforts.

Feel free to share your comments and suggestions with me. Happy exercising!
